# what-i-learned-week-1



### _HTML_

>So this week was probably the most entertaining week i have ever had in any school. Finally got into HTML and learned how to create a web page. It was interesting to learn about the inner workings of a website. It was like being Neo in the matrix.>

>Watching my peers present their projects is where i learned the tips and tricks on issues i have struggled with. Through then I learned how to finally insert a gif in a webpage without it just linking to the source of the page (I'm looking at you giphy).

> I also learned how to really work with links through the "Adventures of Link" stories we created as a class. Through this I created a cohesive string of webpages and links.>

>The homework given also encouraged me to do my own research and learn some basics concepts in CSS. I pretty much internalized web pages as:
  
  * HTML- The content of the webpage
  * CSS - Styles the webpage
  * Java gives it functions
